    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook reproduces the **controlled simulations** used to isolate the causal effects of mobility attractors on potential route diversification.  \n",
    "By modeling an artificial city as a **regular grid (lattice)**, it allows us to systematically vary the **position**, **number**, and **speed limits** of attractors while keeping all other network properties constant.\n",
    "\n",
    "For clarity, only the core simulation logic is presented here, but all configuration parameters (e.g., grid size, attractor placement, and speed ratios) are easily customizable within the accompanying code.\n",
    "\n",
    "These experiments confirm the mechanisms observed in real cities and demonstrate how the placement and tuning of mobility attractors affect DiverCity both locally and globally. The outputs correspond to the results shown in *Figure 5* of the paper.\n",
