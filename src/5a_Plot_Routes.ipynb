    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook produces illustrative maps for individual origin–destination (OD) pairs, showing how alternative routes overlap or diverge depending on city structure and network characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations are essential for interpreting the DiverCity measure, as they help illustrate cases of:\n",
    "- **Low DiverCity**: strong overlap among near-shortest routes (high route concentration).  \n",
    "- **High DiverCity**: spatially diverse near-shortest routes with minimal overlap.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Theis notebook may help generating:\n",
    "- **Route Maps** - Showing spatial overlap and route diversity for selected OD pairs.  \n",
    "- **Map Insets** - Zoomed visualizations for specific OD pairs.  \n",
    "- **Optional Overlays** - Highlighting mobility attractors or high-traffic corridors.\n",
    "\n",
    "These visualizations can be used to create figures similar to *Figure 1a–b* and *Figure 4* of the DiverCity paper,  which illustrate examples of low- and high-diversification trips and the spatial distribution of near-shortest routes. The notebook can also be adapted to visualize additional cities, configurations, or speed-reduction scenarios."
