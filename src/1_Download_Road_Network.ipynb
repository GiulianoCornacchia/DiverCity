    "This notebook handles the download, preparation, and storage of road networks from **OpenStreetMap (OSM)** using the **OSMnx** Python package. It represents the first step of the DiverCity workflow.\n",
    "Starting from the geographic center of each city, the script retrieves a drivable road network within a fixed radius, applies standard simplifications, and saves the resulting graph for further processing.\n",

    "### **Parameters Used in This Study:**  \n",
    "- **Location:** Defined by geographic coordinates of the city center, sourced from [latlong.net](https://www.latlong.net/).  \n",
    "- **Radius:** **30 km (30,000 meters)**, ensuring comprehensive coverage of the urban area. TIP: consider adding a 1-2km buffer to minimize border effects.\n",
    "- **Network Type:** `drive`, focusing on car navigable roads.  \n",
    "- **Simplification:** `True`, simplifying the graph by removing intermediate nodes while preserving connectivity. This reduces computational complexity for subsequent analysis.  \n",
