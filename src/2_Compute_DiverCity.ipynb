    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook computes the **DiverCity measure** for a selected city using the preprocessed road network generated in *Notebook 1*.  \n",
    "It implements the **Path Penalization (PP)** algorithm to generate near-shortest alternative routes and computes the **DiverCity measure**, quantifying the potential route diversification between origin–destination pairs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the DiverCity framework, the computation involves:\n",
    "- Loading the city’s processed road network.  \n",
    "- Defining penalization (`p`) and tolerance threshold (`ε`) parameters for near-shortest route generation.  \n",
    "- Computing alternative routes using **Path Penalization**.  \n",
    "- Evaluating route diversification.\n",

    "## **DiverCity Definition**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each trip between an origin `u` and a destination `v`, DiverCity quantifies how many **distinct near-shortest routes** exist and **how spatially diverse** they are.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is defined as:\n",
    "\n",
    "$D(u,v) = S(\\text{NSR}(u,v)) \\cdot |\\text{NSR}(u,v)|$\n",
    "\n",
    "where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **NSR(u,v)** is the set of *near-shortest routes* between `u` and `v`, i.e., routes whose travel cost does not exceed that of the fastest route by more than *ε*%.\n",
    "* **S(NSR(u,v)) = 1 − J(NSR(u,v))**, where *J* is the average *weighted Jaccard similarity* among all route pairs, capturing their spatial overlap.\n",
    "* A high `S` indicates spatially diverse alternatives, while a high `|NSR|` indicates numerous near-shortest routes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, **DiverCity** increases when a trip has *many distinct* and *loosely overlapping* feasible routes.\n",
