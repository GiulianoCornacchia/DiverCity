    "## **Overview**\n",
    "This notebook computes **mobility attractor–related measures** that are essential for interpreting and contextualizing the DiverCity results.  \n",
    "Mobility attractors, such as highways, trunks, and ring roads, are key infrastructures that influence route choice and spatial patterns of route diversification.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## **Mobility Attractors**\n",
    "Mobility attractors are high-capacity road infrastructures that channel large traffic volumes and provide faster connections across the city, such as highways, ring roads, and major arterial routes.\n",
    "In this study, attractors are identified as edges classified as `motorway` or `trunk` in the OpenStreetMap road network.\n",
    " \n",
    "1. **Attractor Density** - Measure the total attractor length per unit area (km/km²).  \n",
    "2. **Assess Spatial Dispersion (H)** - Quantify how evenly attractors are distributed using the mean distance of random points to the nearest attractor.  \n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Results are saved in the output directory for integration into other notebooks."
